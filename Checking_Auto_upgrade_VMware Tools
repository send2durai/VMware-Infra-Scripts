### This is the page, where you can see how to Check and upgrade VMware Tools before each power on. 

Typically, this option you can see it in the EDIT settings of a Virtual Machine.

Go to a "TEST" vm >> Right Click and Select Edit settings >> Click on VM Options (Next to Virtual Hardware option)
The option should be under "VMware Tools" >> Tools Upgrade. By default the Tools Upgrade option should be disabled (unchecked)
If it's checked, we need to be disabled it whenever you want to set it as manual upgrade instead "Auto Upgrade" on each power cycle.

To set it as Manual or disable option of the Tools Upgrade on a single or bunch of vm's, we can use PowerCli Script,

$vCenter = Connect-VIServer lab.example.com -User abc -Password xyz
Write-Host "$vCenter  is successfully connected" -f Cyan -B Black
Write-Host "MANUALLY set VMware Tools upgrade on vm's" -f Cyan -BackgroundColor Black
$virtualmacs =  Get-Content C:\Users\thangadurai\Music\vm.txt
$virtualmacs
Start-Sleep -Seconds 1
$vmw = Get-VM test1,test2 | Get-View   ## test1, test2 are the vm names. Instead passing directly on the Get-VM, you can use $variable as well.
Start-Sleep -Seconds 1
$vmconfigSpec = New-Object VMware.Vim.VirtualMachineConfigSpec
$vmConfigSpec.Tools = New-Object VMware.Vim.ToolsConfigInfo
$vmConfigSpec.Tools.ToolsUpgradePolicy = "manual"
$vmw.ReconfigVM($vmConfigSpec)
Write-Host "Disable VMware Tools AUTO upgrade on vm $virtualmacs" -f Cyan -b Black

Note: If it's one or two vm's we can directly feed the vm names in the "Get-VM" cmdlet. If it's a bunch of vm's like more than 100 vm's, you need to a user a $variable file, in which
you need to keep all the vm names. Input file should be a text or .csv as well. 

Also, for loop we need to use to iterate the process.
